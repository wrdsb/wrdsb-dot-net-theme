## About This Software

This .NET Theme is based on the Official WordPress Theme for the WRDSB.

It is used for all WRDSB Websites using .NET (instead of WordPress). All applications and .NET websites refer to this instance of the Theme (it is the cardinal copy).

Both the .NET Theme and the Official WordPress Theme share common assets.
